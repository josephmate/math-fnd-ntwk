\subsubsection{Discrete Time}
$P(X_{n+1} = j | X_n = i_n , X_{n-1} = i_{n-1}, ... , X_0 = i_0)$

\paragraph{Markov Chain Assumption}
$P(X_{n+1} = j | X_n = i_n )$, Applying total probability
$P(X_{n+1} = j ) = \sum_{i} P(X_{n+1} = j |  X_n = i_n) P(X_n = i)$

\paragraph{Homogeneous Markov Chain}
$P(X_{n+1} = j | X_n = i_n ) = p_{ij} \quad \forall i,j$ (IE: independant of n)

\paragraph{Chapman-Kolmogorov Equation}
Let $p_{ij}^(m)$ be the probability of starting from state i and arriving at state j in m steps.
$p_{ij}^{(m)} = \sum_k p_{ik} p_{kj}^{(m-1)} = \sum_k p_{ik}^{(m-1)}p_{kj}$

\paragraph{Irreducible Markov Chain} Every state can be reached from every other state.

\paragraph{Recurrence}
Let $f_j^{(n)}$ be the probability of first returning to j occurs n steps after leaving j. \\
Let $f_j = sum_{n=1}^\infty f_j^{(n)}$, then
state is recurrent $\iff f_j = 1$

\paragraph{Recurrent Non-null}
Let $M_j = \sum_{n=1}^\infty n f_j^{(n)}$ then state j is recurrent non-null
$\iff M_j <<< \infty$. Otherwise, it's recurrent null.

\paragraph{Periodicity} The number of steps to come back is $cn$, where $c > 1$

\paragraph{State Probability}
Let $\pi_j^{(n)} = P(X_n = j)$

\paragraph{Homogenerous State Probability}
$\pi_j^{(n+1)} = \sum_j p_{ij} \pi_i^{(n)}$. Given all $\pi_j^{(0)}$, you can
compute any state.

\paragraph{Steady State Probability} If aperiodic irreducible homogeneous Markov
Chain then $\pi_j = \lim_{n \to \infty} \pi_j^{(n)}$ and can be computed using
the system of equations:
\begin{align*}
	\pi_j = \sum_i p_{ij} \pi_i \quad \forall j \\
	\sum_i \pi_j = 1
\end{align*}

\paragraph{Memoryless Property} Residence time in a state has the memoryless
property. The prob you state m steps, and leave on the $(j+1)^{th}$ is
$p_{jj}^m(1-p_{jj})$. This has the memoryless property.
